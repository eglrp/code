Update information:

1.00
First c++ version of SEED2COR for 9 component cross-correlation

1.01
Improve memory manipulation in doCor function, making it capable to do cc up to 5 Hz.

1.02
Improve memory manipulation in SacRec::Smooth function, making it capable to do cc up to 10 Hz.

1.03
Added skip flags: 
fskipesac       2 = skip; 1 = skip upon existence of target file; 0 = do not skip
fskipresp       2 = skip; 1 = skip upon existence of target file; 0 = do not skip
fskipamph       2 = skip; 1 = skip upon existence of target file; 0 = do not skip
fskipcrco       3 = skip; 2 = skip cc but do stacking according to CCtodolist; 1 = skip upon existence of target file; 0 = do not skip

Added delete flag:
fdelosac        1 = delete extracted SAC; 2 = delete removed resp SAC; 3 = delete both; 0 = keep both
fdelamph	1 = delete amp&ph files; 0 = keep them

Modified CorOutflag: 
0 = output monthly stack_all and delete daily
1 = only output daily
2 = output monthly, daily and stack_all
3 = delete monthly and daily, only output stack_all

Modified optional station flag:
positive numbers: do autocorrelation
negative numbers: do NOT do autocorrelation

1.04 
Improved stacking process, making it parallel and more efficient to deal with large scale computation
Improved rotation process, making it parallel. 

Delete CorOutflag:

Added fdeldaily
0 = keep daily data
1 = delete daily data

Added fdelmonthly
0 = keep monthly data
1 = delete monthly data

Added fmonthstack
0 = do monthly stack
1 = skip monthly stack if exists
2 = skip monthly stack

Added fstackall
0 = do stack all
1 = skip stack all if exists
2 = skip stack all

1.05
Add CorOutflag again, delete fmonthstack, fdelmonthly, fdeldaily.

Rewrite cross-correlation, making it do daily cc of all the components for one station pair. 
Monthly stacking data is generated without read daily cc data and stacking.

1.06
Modify the the List Generating process( station list, monthdir list, channel list, CCtodo list) making them become functions in the CCList.cpp

Modify the "SacRec::arrange" member function, making it capable to arrange any number of daily sac files
 
Modify the main function, if npts of extracted sac file is less than 1, skip the preporcessing

Modify the channel prefix, making it able to rename with channels with prefix from channel list

Modify the cut function in SacRec.cpp due to a bug.

Fix a bug when merging daily data(FillGap).

Fix the wrong number for CHsize=2, ch1=(int)(f/3) to ch1=(int)(f/CHsize)

Some minor modifications. 

1.07
Change CCRec_List for consuming from deque to vector, making it safer when inserting new record (The Random ghost bug seems to be fixed!)

1.08
Added amplitude correction according to efftive length of xCorr

1.09
Deprecated Stack All and Rotation ( Will be done in NoisePy)

Modify channel list, making the code can do CC for different channel prefix
(parameter file is different for this version!)
